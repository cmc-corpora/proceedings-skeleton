# Pre-Conference Proceedings

This LaTeX skeleton was used to produce the pre-conference online proceedings:
basically, it wraps the individual contributions into a single pdf document. 

It also has pointers to CLI-based zenodo (re-)uploads of individual
contributions and their metadata, and the full proceedings.
